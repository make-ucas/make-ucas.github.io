Hi! I'm Ke Ma(马坷), an Associate Professor (Tenure-track Assistant Professor) with the School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I got my Ph.D. degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS) in 2019, supervised by Prof. [Xiaochun Cao](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xiaochun) (Professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen Compus, China). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with [Qingming Huang](https://qmhuang-ucas.github.io/) (IEEE Fellow), [Qianqian Xu](https://qianqianxu010.github.io/) (Professor at ICT CAS), [Yuan Yao](https://yao-lab.github.io/) (Professor at HKUST), [Jiechao Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X8YIcKEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Research Fellow at Tencent Lab AI Lab), [Zhiyong Yang](https://joshuaas.github.io/) (Associate Professor at UCAS), [Yangbangyan Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4Zm5d8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Postdoc at UCAS), [Xiaojun Jia](https://jiaxiaojunqaq.github.io/) (Research Fellow at NTU), and [Siyuan Liang](https://liangsiyuan21.github.io/) (Research Fellow at NUS).

I'm especially interested in several fundamental problems in machine learning:

- <a  style="font-weight: bold;">Adversarial Learning</a>
- <a  style="font-weight: bold;">Robust Optimization</a>
- <a  style="font-weight: bold;">Robust Game Theory</a>

<span style="color: #b509ac">I'm always looking for highly self-motivated PhD/Master students!</span>
